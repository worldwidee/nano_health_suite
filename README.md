## Breaking Update
Although I securely hold the token from the login service, I did not add that feature because automatic user authentication is desired or not. Recent updates:
* If the autoAuth value is set to true in the setup function of AppSettings, it will automatically redirect to the home page in case of a registered token
* Added security system that listens to user auth to the application route system. 


## Last updates:
* added slide transation from left to right when going to detail page
* some improvements have been made to the login page
* if the page cannot be loaded because the internet connection is interrupted, the page is automatically reloaded when the user regains internet access
* added page refresh feature by scrolling down

A new Flutter project.
